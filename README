== Github Follow{ers,ing} using Yahoo! Pipes

This is a very simple Cappuccino application that uses Yahoo! Pipes to
retrieve Github followers and followings.

Of course, this could have been done with the Github API, but it all
started out with a couple of Yahoo pipes and went from there.

== Motivation

Combining Yahoo! Pipes with Cappuccino and using bindings to build an GUI.

The Pipes used for this can be found here:

And Cappuccino can be found here http://cappuccino.org

== Demo

Demo can be found here http://gitfol.2monki.es

== Limitations

Because the Pipes only retrieve the first page of the following and followers, a
maximum of 20 for both will be shown.

== Thanks

Thanks to Mafis for the bindings example: https://github.com/mafis/Cappuccino-Bindings-Demo
