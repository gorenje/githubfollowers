== Github Followers using Yahoo! Pipes

This is a very simple Cappuccino application that uses a Yahoo! Pipe to
retrieve Github followers.

== Motivation

Wanting to combine Yahoo! Pipes with Cappuccino!

No real motivation, just bring some technologies together.

The Pipe used for this can be found here:

http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=88908111d5b1a32c1c41aefa25fa188d

And Cappuccino can be found here http://cappuccino.org

== Technical

What happens is that the Cappuccino application will do a JSONP request
from your browser to Yahoo! to run the pipe. What the pipe will do, is
a request to http://github.com/<username>/followers. The HTML that
is returned is parsed by the Yahoo! pipe and will be outputted as JSON.

The JSON is sucked into the Cappuccino application and the image URLs are
retirieved and shown.

The server that original delivered the Javascript code (that is the Cappuccino
application) does nothing except to send out the Javascript.

== Demo

Demo can be found here http://gitfol.2monki.es

Top row are the users you've already clicked on (i.e. initial none). The images shown,
after entering a github username, are their followers. Click on an image to
the next set of followers.

Note also, depending on Yahoo!, the image may appear quicker or slower -- depending
on your internet connection and that for github and yahoo.
