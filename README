== Github Follow{ers,ing} using Yahoo! Pipes

This is a very simple Cappuccino application that uses Yahoo! Pipes to
retrieve Github followers and followings.

Of course, this could have been done with the Github API, but it all
started out with a couple of Yahoo pipes and went from there.

== Motivation

Combining Yahoo! Pipes with Cappuccino.

The Pipes used for this can be found here:

http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=beb4613138f82f83c456c4cb689feab3 (following)

And Cappuccino can be found here http://cappuccino.org

Also being used are:
 - Bindings to handle the interface updates.
 - JSONP for communication -- for those new to Cappuccino, JSONP is built right in.
 - Specific data views for a TableView -- thanks to CappuTweetie.

== Demo

Demo can be found here http://gitfol.2monki.es

== Limitations

Because the Pipes only retrieve the first page of the following and followers, a
maximum of 20 for both will be shown.
